# HuntAsteroids
TODO for Instructors to Specify:
- [ ] Short writeup (100-250 words on challenge)
- [ ] link to many datasets (below probably enough, but add to as needed 
- [ ] some context on how to engage with those using python
- [ ] some examples of other projects solving the challenge on the web (if we choose to build on a NASA challenge this comes built in
